# 07_inheritance



## 00_first_trial.cc

[link to file](./00_first_trial.cc)

A naive and conceptually wrong implementation of a series of classes that share data.

PPP: chap 14.3
CPL: chap 20.1, 20.2



## 01_inheritance.cc

[link to file](./01_inheritance.cc)

A wrong implementation with *inheritance*. In particular, the run-time polymorphism is not working.

PPP: chap 14.3
CPL: chap 20.1, 20.2



## 02_virtual.cc

[link to file](./02_virtual.cc)

This program shows the usage of the `virtual` keyword when working with derived classes methods.
The specifier `override` is used to force the compiler to check that we are actually overriding a function of the base class.

PPP: chap 14.3.2
CPL: chap 3.2.2, 3.2.3, 3.2.4 for an introduction, chap 20 for more details




## 03_virtual_destructor.cc

[link to file](./03_virtual_destructor.cc)

Shows the order in which the constructors and the destructors for derived objects are
called. Using run-time polymorphism, to call the proper destructor (and not always and only the destructor of the base class), the destructor of the base class must be *virtual*.

PPP: chap 17.5.2
CPL: chap 17.2.5



## 04_private.cc

[link to file](./04_private.cc)

Trivial example to demonstrate how to deal with parents with private data.

PPP: chap 14.3.5
CPL: chap 20.4



## 05_dynamic_cast.cc

[link to file](./05_dynamic_cast.cc)

This example illustrates the usage of dynamic casting to perform a type conversion at run-time.

PPP: appendix A.5.7
CPL: chap 22.2.1



## 06_template.cc

[link to file](./06_template.cc)

When we inherit from a templated class, we need to use `this->` to access parent's member.

CPL: chap 26.3.7



## 07_using.cc

[link to file](./07_using.cc)

Functions do not overload across scopes.

CPL: chap 12.3.3, 20.3.5



## example of structured library
[link_to_folder](./organized)

Example of how to document and organized a simple library.
