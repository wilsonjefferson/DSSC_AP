# Advanced Programming [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/asartori86/advanced_programming_2019-20.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/asartori86/advanced_programming_2019-20)

[SISSA webpage](http://www.math.sissa.it/course/phd-course-master-course/advanced-programming-1)

The course aims to provide advanced knowledge of both theoretical and practical programming in C++11 and Python3, with particular regard to the principles of object-oriented programming and best practices of software development.

Syllabus:

- Introduction to C++11. You will learn the logic and the basics of C++11, the built-in data types and how to effectively use them. Best practices in programming will be addressed.
- Object orientation in C++11. The principles of Object-Oriented programming will be presented with particular attention to their implementations in C++11. Some of the most important Design Patterns will be discussed.
- Advanced features of C++14/17. Some of the new features of standard C++/14/17 will be introduced and explained.
- Python3. After a recap of the basics of Python3, you will learn how to program in object-oriented fashion in the Python3 programming language.
- How to combine the two languages. Several methods to combine the two languages will be presented.


## Prerequisites
- Familiarity with linux terminal and a text editor (e.g., emacs, vim)
