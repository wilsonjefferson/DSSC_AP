# Exercises - session 02

## Reverse order

- Write a program that reads from stdin the length of an array and
  then store in it the numbers given from stdin. The program should
  then prints the numbers in **reverse order**. Remember to properly
  free the used memory. You should divide the problem in two parts:

  1. Write one **template** function that allocates on the *heap* one
    array of a given size, initialize its elements and returns the
    pointer to the first element.

  2. Write a **template** function that prints the elements of an
    array in the reverse order.

- Test with integers and doubles.

- Use `std::size_t`.

  ​

*Hints*: 

- If you have to pass an array to a function, pass the pointer to its first element and the size of the array.


- Remember to check your code with `valgrind`. If you  have a MAC you might have bad surprises. Run `valgrind` on a **Linux**  system. Alternatively, compile your code with the flags

  `-g -fsanitize=address`  and then run your executable.

  ​

## Prime numbers

- Populate an array named `primes` containing the first prime numbers
  smaller than 100. Consider 2 as the first prime (i.e. `primes[0] == 2`).
  
  - you are free to choose the design and the implementation.

  - please comment and motivate your choices (e.g., allocate one big
    array or every time I find a new prime number I increase the size of
    the previous `primes` array, etc.)

*Hints*:

- The remainder of a division between two integers can be computed as
  follows:
```c++
unsigned int remainder = 6%3;
```
- Inside a for loop, you can use `continue` to immediately go to the
  next iteration, `break` to exit the loop. Note that if you have two
  or more nested loops, the statements affect only the innermost loop.



## Sieve of Eratosthenes

- Implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. Write a code that
  prints on screen the first prime numbers up to `N` **included**, where `N`
  is read from stdin. The first prime number that should be printed is `2`

```shell
$ ./a.out 
insert number: 5
2
3
5

$ ./a.out
insert number: 10
2
3
5
7
```

*Hints*:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes :)

- the function `std::sqrt`, which computes the square root of a number, can
  be found in `<cmath>`
```c++
#include <cmath>
...
std::cout << std::sqrt(4) << std::endl;
```

## **Optional**: Use `std::vector`
Re-implement the exercises *Prime numbers* and *Sieve of Eratosthenes* using `std::vector` instead of arrays.
